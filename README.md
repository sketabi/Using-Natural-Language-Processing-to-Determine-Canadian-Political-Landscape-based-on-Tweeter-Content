# Using-Natural-Language-Processing-to-Determine-Canadian-Political-Landscape-based-on-Tweeter-Content
The aim of this project is to analyze the sentiment of the tweets related to the 2019 Canadian election. After performing pre-processing tasks including removing stop words, punctuations, hashtags, and so on, I implemented 2 methods for feature selection: bag of words, and TF-IDF. Then, I applied a number of machine learning algorithms, namely Logistic Regression, SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to the data. The best achieved accuracy is 0.59 using Logistic Regression.
